If you want to put your .tex file into seperated directory, you have to create a file named 'config.mk` inside it.
like the git-flow example, you can define template information there or just keep it empty.
But this file IS NECESSARY.

Compile these file requires pdflatex and beamer extension:

I recommand texlive distribution: http://www.tug.org/texlive/
And beamer class: https://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/wiki/Home
